<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- The project aims at develop a 5-DoF manipulator capable of precise imitation of the human arm. The manipulator will be tested in a simulated environment and then implemented in reality.

- The first challenge is to track the position of human joints and acquire joint parameters data.
A motion-capture system consisting of sensors attached to the human arm as well as vision-based
solutions using tracking cameras will be used for the purpose.

- The next challenge is to map the motion of the human to the manipulator, with kinematic and dynamic
modeling of the manipulator for precise and accurate control.

- After establishing a stable system for arm imitation, it will be tested on applications like pick-and-place and tracing a curve.
